It supports multilingual text and image input, and produces multilingual text and code output across 12 supported languages. Optimized for vision-language tasks, Maverick is instruction-tuned for assistant-like behavior, image reasoning, and general-purpose multimodal interaction.\n\nMaverick features early fusion for native multimodality and a 1 million token context window. It was trained on a curated mixture of public, licensed, and Meta-platform data, covering ~22 trillion tokens, with a knowledge cutoff in August 2024.

Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.\n- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase. Reasoning tokens here are a bit different than the CoTs in the answer - these are tokens that we use to reason through the research material prior to generating the outputs via the CoTs. Reasoning tokens are priced at $3/1M tokens",

          "description": "GLM-4.5V is a vision-language foundation model for multimodal agent applications. Built on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with 106B parameters and 12B activated parameters, it achieves state-of-the-art results in video understanding, image Q&A, OCR, and document parsing, with strong gains in front-end web coding, grounding, and spatial reasoning. It offers a hybrid inference mode: a \"thinking mode\" for deep reasoning and a \"non-thinking mode\" for fast responses. Reasoning behavior can be toggled via the `reasoning` `enabled` boolean.

These models were trained with Phi-3 datasets that include both synthetic data and the filtered, publicly available websites data, with a focus on high quality and reasoning-dense properties. Phi-3.5 Mini uses 3.8B parameters, and is a dense decoder-only transformer model using the same tokenizer as [Phi-3 Mini](/models/microsoft/phi-3-mini-128k-instruct).\n\nThe models underwent a rigorous enhancement process, incorporating both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization to ensure precise instruction adherence and robust safety measures. When assessed against benchmarks that test common sense, language understanding, math, code, long context and logical reasoning, Phi-3.5 models showcased robust and state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters.",

It prioritizes Japanese language performance while retaining strong English capabilities. The model was optimized entirely through post-training, using a refined mix of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and DPO datasets including regenerated ShareGPT-style data, translation tasks, roleplaying conversations, and instruction-following prompts. Unlike earlier Shisa releases, this version avoids tokenizer modifications or extended pretraining.\n\nShisa V2 70B achieves leading Japanese task performance across a wide range of custom and public benchmarks, including JA MT Bench, ELYZA 100, and Rakuda. It supports a 128K token context length and integrates smoothly with inference frameworks like vLLM and SGLang. While it inherits safety characteristics from its base model, no additional alignment was applied. The model is intended for high-performance bilingual chat, instruction following, and translation tasks across JA/EN.",
